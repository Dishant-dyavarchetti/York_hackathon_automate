# 🚀 York Hackathon Automate – First Hackathon Project

### 🌟 One-Click Dev Workflow Automation: From JIRA Ticket to GitHub Deployment

This project was built during our **first ever hackathon** at **York IE**. As Team **Alt-Tab-Push**, we set out to automate a developer’s entire workflow: from fetching a JIRA ticket to generating and deploying a Python project — all in one seamless flow using GPT-4o.

---

## 💡 Project Highlights

### ✅ What It Does

- 🧾 Fetches JIRA tickets from a board
- ⚙️ Interprets the title + description with GPT-4o
- 🛠️ Generates a production-ready Python project (e.g., weather app)
- 📤 Auto-pushes the code to GitHub
- ✅ Updates the ticket status in JIRA

### 🧪 Applied To: Weather App Use Case

- 🌍 Multi-city comparison
- 📊 Dynamic weather visualizations
- ☀️ 5-day forecast
- 🏙️ City autocomplete
- 📍 Location-based weather

## 🔧 Tech Stack

- 🤖 **LLM**: GPT-4o
- 🗂️ **JIRA API**: `jira` library with Basic Auth
- 🐍 **Backend**: Python
- ⚙️ **Automation Libraries**: `python-dotenv`, `PyGithub`, `GitPython`
- 💻 **IDE**: Void IDE
- 🚀 **Deployment**: Auto GitHub push (CI-ready)
- 🧠 **Prompting**: Custom prompts based on JIRA title & description

---

## 🧠 Lessons Learned

- LLMs are powerful, but need guardrails
- Don't skip proper testing, even in a hackathon
- Toolchain understanding matters
- JIRA APIs have steep learning curves under pressure
- Last-minute changes can break production!

## 📬 Let’s Connect

Interested in how we structured GPT prompts or built the automation pipeline?  
Feel free to reach out or raise issues!

## 📸 Fun Fact

We’d never used the JIRA API before this hackathon. We learned it *during* the event — pivoted from OAuth2 to Basic Auth — and made it work under pressure.

---

## 🏁 Status

The project is still a WIP. The automation pipeline is functional but needs:
- Fine-tuned GPT prompts
- Error handling for deployment
- Full OAuth2 integration for JIRA
